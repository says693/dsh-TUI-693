 * Per-line character budget for transcript text.
 *
 * A single source line longer than this is clipped BEFORE it reaches the
 * layout engine. Wrapping is what costs: one minified-JS line, a 300k-char
 * pasted log line, or a file written through a tool call turns into
 * thousands of visual rows, and the per-frame wrap + measure over that text
 * (not the row count) is what stalls the transcript. Clipping at the source
 * keeps the rendered line count — and therefore the layout work — bounded
 * no matter what the model, the user, or a tool pastes in.
 *
 * 1000 characters is roughly ten terminal rows at a common width: long
 * enough that ordinary prose, commands and URLs never notice, short enough
 * that the pathological single line cannot dominate a frame. The exact
 * threshold is a display choice, not a contract — `Ctrl+O` (global
 * transcript expansion) always paints the raw text.
